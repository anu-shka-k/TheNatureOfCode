# The-Nature-of-Code-Examples Python

This is the repository has Python implementations of [The Nature of Code Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vX8wT1G798&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFlwukCmDf0-1-uSR7mklK). 

The Youtube playlist is based on The-Nature-of-Code book, whose website is [here](http://natureofcode.com/).  If you are looking for the book's raw content (text, illustrations, images, CSS, etc.), have a look at [The Nature of Code repo](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code).

The original [Processing](http://processing.org) examples [can be found here](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples), along with a [list of other ports](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples/blob/master/README.md).

This port is made possible by [PyP5](https://github.com/p5py/p5).

## Installation
- Preriquisite for p5: glfw from https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases/tag/3.3.8 
- Extract .zip files and copy system path of unzipped folder
- Locate the “Environment Variables” settings dialog box.
- Find and highlight the “Path” variable and click the edit button.
- Add the copied path to the end of the list and save the settings.
- `pip install p5 --user` command in conda environment.



## Note
- Though pycharm shows red underline for p5 and other functions ignore them.
- Pycharm shows syntax error for variables like 'width', 'height', etc. But they can be used as is. They are defined in 'bulletin' module(?) in Github_p5\p5\sketch\userspace.py
